## :hammer_and_wrench: Compile

### Dependencies Required

- `libgtk-3-dev`
- `libgranite-dev`
- `meson`
- `valac`
- if you are on elementary OS 5 you will need [elementary-stylesheet](https://github.com/elementary/stylesheet)

  > Note: for non elementary distros you will need to install [elementary-icons](https://github.com/elementary/icons) and [elementary-stylesheet](https://github.com/elementary/stylesheet)

### Compile and Run

Once the above mentioned dependencies are resolved, Photostat can be compiled and installed.

```sh
meson build --prefix=/usr
cd build
sudo ninja install
```

Note: If you are having trouble with compiling, try [building with flatpak](#build-with-flatpak).

## Build With Flatpak

(Recommended for machines that are not running elementary OS 6)

`flatpak-builder build com.github.photostat_editor.photostat.yml --user --install --force-clean`

Once the command above is complete, you'll be able to launch the app from your applications list.

Note: Since flatpak apps runs in a sandbox, some development operations will be different from how you would usually perform them. Please refer to the Flatpak documentation for help: https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/index.html
